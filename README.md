A parametric model which allows you to put a honeycomb storage wall on a flat
surface without drilling holes.
There are plenty of designs out there, but they are all for the 3M command
strips.

Here in central europe these are not that common, so I made the design
parametric so you can also use the TESA power strips or any other brand.
